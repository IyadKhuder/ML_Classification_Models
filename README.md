# ML_Classification_Models

In this Notebook, I'm covering the following classification models, so they can be compared to each other.

I. Logistic Regression

II. K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)

III. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

IV. Kernel SVM

V. Naive Bayes

VI. Decision Tree Classification

VII. Random Forest Classification


In this notebook, you don't need to worry about the dataset, because it's hosted on my Google Drive and made public. It's then imported using the necessary libraries and code. On the other hand, in v.1.1 the dataset needs to be hosted on your Google Drive, and therefore you should upload it on your Google Drive and then connect to it using the necessary code.


with best regards,
